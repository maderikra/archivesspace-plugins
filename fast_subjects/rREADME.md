This plugin incorporates OCLC's <a href="http://experimental.worldcat.org/fast/assignfast/">assignFAST application</a> into the New Subject interface to allow users to dynamically look up and add FAST subject headings to ArchivesSpace.


After the user selects the desired FAST heading, it's converted to MARCBreaker format and is then parsed via JavaScript into the appropriate fields on the web form.
