Plugin to replace the default pagination (which is not ideal for navigating among large result sets, since users can only move forward 10 pages at a time) with the following format:

**<<  Page [ 1 ]  of  30  >>**

Users can navigate to different pages by entering the desired page number in a text box or by using the navigation arrows. Compatible with ArchivesSpace v2.4.
